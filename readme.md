# Redux CRUD

Fork of https://github.com/Versent/redux-crud

# Changelog

From the original redux-crud

- split the reducer on two reducers : reducer and status. Status reducer permits to be notified of errors
- add fetchStart and fetchError on the reducer (status)

- another enhancement will be integrated from https://github.com/JacquesBonet/redux-easy-crud to simplify the interface.
